# Loki

Grafana Loki is a log management tool that stores logs indexing only key labels instead of all the text.
This makes it faster to scale and cheaper to run compared to traditional full-text search systems.

---

## How it works

To get server logs into Loki, you use a tool that:

- Reads the log files as they are written.

- Attaches metadata labels (such as the application name, environment, or server).

- Sends the labeled log entries to Lokiâ€™s API for storage.

Loki stores the logs in chunks along with their labels, so you can query by filtering on those labels.

The flow is like this

```bash
[ log source ] --> [ log tool ] --> [ Loki Distributor ] --> [ S3 ]
```

Happy logging.
