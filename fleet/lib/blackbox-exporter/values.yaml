# TODO: Error: UPGRADE FAILED: release blackbox-exporter failed, and has been
# rolled back due to atomic being set: failed to create resource: admission
# webhook "prometheusrulemutate.monitoring.coreos.com" denied the request: Cannot
# unmarshal rules from spec
# This error happens due to the fact that the PrometheusRules from the blackbox
# exporter chart seem to be uncompatible with the new CRD's from the prometheus
# operator being deployed. It would be good to have these deployed as well but
# currently we're temporary disabling them.
